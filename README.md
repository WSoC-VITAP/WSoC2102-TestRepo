## Project Details

- This project focuses on creating an application that automatically adds items to a shopping list by snapping a picture of the item you wish to buy and adding the product name and price.

- Users can either take a picture of the item they want to add or type it in like a standard shopping list app.

    ```
- 	Step 2:
